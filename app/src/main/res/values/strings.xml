    <string name="description_find_podcast">Find Podcasts is the first activity presented to the user. It allows the user to search for a podcast using the search function. Once the user enters in the name of a podcast, we need to use a service such as Digital Podcast Search Service to query for results. This is a REST based service and operates via HTTP request, working similar to a web browser. When the user gets back their results, they can click on their podcast and will be take to the Add Podcast activity, where they choose to add the podcast to their library.</string>
    <string name="description_subscribe_podcast">In the Add Podcast activity, the user can choose to add a podcast to their library. Adding a podcast will essentially add its download location given from the Digital Podcast Search Service query.</string>
